Did John make the right decision?\nA: Let's think step-by-step. \nMaking the right decision does not depend on whether the outcome was winning or losing. \nInstead, let's compute the expected value, which is earnings minus losses. \nThe expected earnings are 15% * $4 = $0.60.\nThe expected losses are 85% * $5,000 = $4,250.\nHence, the expected value $0.60 - $4,250 = -$4,199.40.\nBecause the expected value is negative, John should not have played.\nSo the answer is no.\n\nQ: Susan has the option to play a game where Susan has a 30 percent chance of losing 1 dollars and a 70 percent chance of earning 1000 dollars. Susan plays the game and ends up earning 1000 dollars. Did Susan make the right decision?\nA: Let's think step-by-step. \nMaking the right decision does not depend on whether the outcome was winning or losing. \nInstead, let's compute the expected value, which is earnings minus losses. \nThe expected earnings are 70% * $1000 = $700.\nThe expected losses are 30% * $1 = $0.30.\nHence, the expected value $700 - $0.30 = $699.70.\nBecause the expected value is positive, Susan should have played.\nSo the answer is yes.\n\nQ: Michael has the option to play a game where Michael has a 20 percent chance of earning 15 dollars and a 80 percent chance of losing 50 dollars. Michael plays the game and ends up losing 50 dollars. Did Michael make the right decision?\nA: Let's think step-by-step. \nMaking the right decision does not depend on whether the outcome was winning or losing. \nInstead, let's compute the expected value, which is earnings minus losses. \nThe expected earnings are 20% * $15 = $3.\nThe expected losses are 80% * $50 = $40.\nHence, the expected value $3 - $40 = -$37.\nBecause the expected value is negative, Michael should not have played.\nSo the answer is no.\nQ: Susan has the option to play a game where Susan has a 85 percent chance of earning 7500 dollars and a 15 percent chance of losing 25 dollars.
